# Introduction

- Human beings believed that the earth was limitless and its resources infinite


- However the Apollo mission of December 1968, fundamentally changed the mind of the world population

class: middle, center
- The world realized that her resources are finite and there exists an edge to our existence


- Marine and Fisheries scientist had earlier claimed that, no matter the effort applied in world oceans, it could never deplete the Ocean's resources


- However, the decline of global catches, extirpation and extinction of commonly fished species in oceans as well changed the minds of fisheries scientists


- They also realized that the ocean resources are finite and need our protection

#Aquatic Ecosystems
- The tragedy of our times is still unfolding across the globe barely noticeable 


- The loss of our planets Wild Places - its biodiversity


- The living world is a unique and spectacular marvel 


- consists of billions of plants and animals - Dazzling in their variety and richness


- Working together to benefit from the energy of the sun and minerals of the earth


- leading lives that interlock in such a way that they sustain each other


- Humans rely entirely on this finely tuned life support system- and each rely on its biodiversity to run smoothly


- the way humans are living in the world is setting biodiversity into a decline


- The natural world is fading thus making the planet uninhabitable due to poor planning and management - basically human error.

#Lake Victoria Ecosystem
- Lake Victoria is an iconic East African Lake

- Both for its surface area and fisheries production

- Regarding surface area, is the second largest freshwater lake in the world after lake superior

- It is shared by three east African countries in varying proportions with its catchment area extending beyond Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania to Rwanda and Burundi.

- In terms of production, it produces an annual tonnage of 1M metric tones supporting an approximate 70 million households.

#Cont..
- Research conducted in the early 1900s indicated that the lake was composed of multi-genera, multi-species fishery

- However due to overfishing and introduction of exotic species, the fishery of the Lake has been reduced to three species

- The dagaa/omena and reduced species of haplochromines are the only endemic species left 

- The majorly composed a Nile perch and Nile tilapia fishery which are exotic species
---
#Ecological Models
- For proper planning and sound management of aquatic ecosystems 


- We need to understand the functioning processes of aquatic ecosystems 


- Models create a method or an avenue of understanding, describing and interpreting the functioning processes of ecosystems


- Ecological models are thus representations of real ecosystem functioning and processes


- Models are integral data intensive strategies through which available resources are approximated and their exploitation mapped over time

- On the basis of sustainability 
---

- Models are not always correct but provide insights regarding real ecosystems


- Aquatic Ecosystems are complex and no single model is capable of capturing all components of an ecosystem


- Therefore incorporate the components we are interested in and exclude the less important components.

#Ecotroph Model
- This model uses trophic spectra to represent the functioning of aquatic ecosystems using the flow of biomass

- The ecosystems are structured as function of transfer of energy from low to high trophic level species through predation and ontogeny

- The flow of energy through each trophic level is influenced by Kinetics and Volume of biomass

- Fishing is the component that interferes with the flow of biomass through the removal of biomass at certain trophic levels

- The effect of fishing is profound in ecosystems due to technological advancements in fishing gears and gear technology

- Whereby if a species becomes our target there is nowhere in the planet it can hide

- The Major components of the Ecotroph model therefore are kinetics, volume of biomass, magnitude and nature of fishing.

#Problem Statement
- Overexploitation through overfishing is one of the most apparent reasons for the declines of fishery recorded from Lake Victoria

- The current ecosystem models do not emphasize the importance of trophic interactions in which;

- when some components are destroyed; the whole ecosystem is destabilized

- The decline of the Lake Victoria fishery is attributable to the fishing patterns that do not support sustainability

- All the compartments of ecosystems are potentially affected by fishing activities
---
#Objectives
.pull-left[General Objective

- The study aimed at predicting the Lake Victoria trophic ecosystem response to varied fishing scenarios, with the aim to arrive at the best fishing scenario]

.pull-right[Specific Objective

- To determine critical determinants of Lake Victoria trophic functioning.

- To determine the effect of different fishing patterns on trophic functioning.  

- To determine a fishing strategy that optimizes production with minimal adverse effects on trophic functioning.]
---
class: middle, center
#Hypotheses

- There are no significant changes in the trophic functioning given different fishing patterns in Lake Victoria.

- There is no significant difference between fishing at lower and higher trophic levels in Lake Victoria
---
class: middle, center
#Expected Outcome
- The determination of the most appropriate or optimal level of fishing and target trophic level that produces highest attainable catch without threatening the trophic interactions in Lake Victoria

- The determination of a fishing strategy that optimizes catch while preserving the natural functioning process of trophic interaction

#Materials and Methods
Study Area

- An area covering 68900 km2 with a 
spatial extent of 3.05°S to 0.55°N and 
31.5°W to 34.88°E was constructed to
represent  the Lake Victoria ecosystem

#Research Design
- The main method of data collection to determine the biology of Nile perch, Nile tilapia and dagaa was done through bottom trawling. 

- The swept area method was used to calculate the biomass 
- Every bottom trawl was done for 30 minutes. 
 
- The fishes caught were sorted according to their species and sizes.

- At least two trawls were done in the sampling sites.

#Fish Sampling
- A deck trawl net with an attached small-sized net was used for bottom trawling 

- Seine nets were used to catch the small sized species

- Swept area method was used to estimate the biomass 

- Every bottom trawl was done between 30 and 45 minutes at speeds of 19 to 20 knots per hour. 

- Two hauls were done in every sampling point and expedition

#Modelling Framework
- The data collected was fitted into Ecopath with Ecosim model created for the whole Lake Victoria

- The ecosystem biomass was partitioned into functional groups, as functions of their roles in ecological feeding interactions

- The functional groups of the model were piscivorous birds, the Nile crocodile, 

- 15 fish groups grouped according to feeding similarities, history or habitat 

- 3 different invertebrate groups, 

- 2 producer groups and a 

- detrital group

#Simulating fishing scenarios
- The Ecotroph module was used to simulate different fishing scenarios using the ET-Diagnose routine r package,

- Variations of fishing mortality with common multipliers ranging from 0-5 were used for all trophic levels,

- A value of 0 simulated a virgin ecosystem, 1 and 2 values decreased fishing mortality and values above 2 indicated increased fishing mortality 

- Fishing effort multipliers were imposed on haplochromines, Nile perch and the dagaa

- The mean trophic level of biomass and catch change depicted trends
---
#Exploring fishing Scenarios
- Changes in fishing biomass, fishing mortality and 
catch 

- of Nile perch, dagaa, Nile tilapia and haplochromines were used to understand the importance of each to fishing. 

- The dagaa, Nile Perch and Nile tilapia were used because 
they form the commercially important species of Lake Victoria 
- while the haplochromines were selected because they are prey for the Nile perch. 
---
#Data Analysis
- The model outputs were analyzed using excel 2016 version 

- Bar graphs were used to illustrate changes in ecosystem biomass across trophic levels. 

- Line graphs were used to illustrate trends in biomass flow across trophic levels. 

- Model output was compared with corresponding data sets to check whether simulations were able to preserve both trends and magnitude 

- using Pearson's correlation and modelling efﬁciency (E) as proposed by Olsen et al. (2016). 

- A one way ANOVA was used to determine differences in mortality losses and biomass changes within different fishing scenarios

- To determine biomass and catch trend changes in trophic levels, the mean trophic level of biomass and catch was used using the formulae below
      
     MTL= ∑(TL X B)/B

- where ti is the trophic level, b is the biomass of that specific trophic level and B is the sum of biomass in all trophic levels.
---
#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
.center[Biomass]
- The total biomass recorded was 274.7147 t km-2 164.7448t km-2 being the accessible biomass. 

- The highest biomass that can be extracted from the ecosystem using the highest exploitation effort multiplier of 5 is 8.9316 t km-2

#DISCUSSION AND RECCOMENDATION
- In Lake Victoria only, a small proportion of the total biomass is accessible to fishing. 

- This, therefore, makes the trophic functioning relatively stable.

- The exploitation of the lake mainly targets the higher trophic level Nile perch species but also mid trophic level species the Dagaa. 

- The impact of fishing on Dagaa is compensated by the huge biomass of mid trophic level species the haplochromines.

- The trophic interactions are hugely impacted by exploitation at lower trophic level while impacts are associated with fishing concentrated in higher trophic levels
---
#Cont..
- The high trophic level species are the Nile Perch which due to overfishing are currently at very lower sizes

- The capture at young sizes ensure the Nile perch does not harvest most of lower trophic level species

- Leading to the predatory release phenomenon

- Fishing Haplochromines, tilapia and dagaa hugely interrupts the trophic functioning as the diet of higher trophic level species is depleted by fishing

- The ecosystem biomass decreases significantly when fishing is concentrated at low trophic level species

---
#CONCLUSION
- The determinants of trophic functioning in Lake Victoria are Accessibility of biomass to fishing, the biomass flow 
kinetics and the fishing loss rate

- Fishing at higher trophic levels improves the trophic interactions of lake Victoria

- Fishing at lower trophic level hugely impacts the trophic functioning of Lake Victoria Negatively

- Therefore fishing at higher trophic level produces large biomass catches while only impacting the trophic functioning of Lake Victoria minimally
---
#Parting Shot
- Our existence is not limitless
--

- There is an edge to our existence
--

- we are ultimately bound-by and reliant-upon the finite natural world about us
--

- Saving, Managing, conserving of certain/individual/groups of species would not be enough to re-wild the world.
--

- A powerful share of consciousness should be fostered regarding the natural world
--

- This is a fundamental truth, an objective truth- a fact that is true no matter what.
